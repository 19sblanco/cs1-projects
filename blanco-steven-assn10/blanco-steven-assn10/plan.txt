1. requirement specification
    create a program that takes input from user: height, width, and location
    of a chessboard. accomplish this with making a module called chessboard.py

2. system analysis
    no formulas

3. system design
    1. import turtle
    2. create module called chess board
        a. define drawChessboard()
            i. should just be the outline
        b. define drawAllRectangles()
            i. based off the user input
            ii. 8x8 black and white
            iii. it can be easier to call function twice
        c. define drawRectangle()
            i. draw single black rectangle
            ii. should repeat with loop
            iii. not sure but will probably be in drawAllRectangles()
    3. put default settings inside the drawChessboard() function
    4. have drawAllRectangles() carry over the settings from drawChessboard()
    5. have drawRectangle() be called by drawAllRectangles()
    6. for drawAllRectangles()
        a. loop through a row of rectangles being drawn
        b. loop through a row of rectangles being drawn
        c. move the cursor starting postion
        d. repeat steps a and b
4. code
5. test
    it should look like a chessboard, given the dimensions
