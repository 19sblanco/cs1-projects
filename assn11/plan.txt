requirement specification
    create a program that will draw circles and rectangles in a circular pattern with rainbow colors.

system analysis
    centerPosition = offset + radius

system design
    1. define all the functions
        a. reset()
        b.setup()
            i. configure turtle to quick draw
            ii. configure turtle to have a window of 1000 x 800
        c.drawRectanglePattern()
            i. use appropriate parameters
            ii. it should call drawRectangle()
        drawRectangle()
            i. appropriate parameters
            ii. should draw single rectangle
        drawCirclePattern()
            i. appropriate parameters
        drawSuperPattern()
            i. use appropriate parameters
            ii. randomly draw Rectangle and circle patterns, each based on random variables
            iii. use reasonable random values, some can be negative, so that patterns draw on screen
        setRandomColor()
            i. don't use parameters
            ii. Set turtle to draw in a random color
            iii. use at least 3 colors
        done()
            i. Called when user quits
            ii. Keeps the turtle window open
    2. circle pattern
        center position - x and y center point of circular pattern drawn
        offset - the distance from the center point to starting point on rectangle
            a. center point is radius + offset
        count - number of circles drawn within 360 pattern
        each drawn with a new random color
    3. rectangle pattern
        center position - center of whole pattern drawn, x and y point
        offset - distance from center to starting point on rectangle
        width
        height
        count - how many shapes drawn
        rotation - The number of degrees each rectangle is rotated in relation to the line from the Center Position to the starting corner of the rectangle
        each drawn with a new random color
    4. End with 3 options
        a. two of which keeps playing, but one resets the board
        b. the other one quits playing

implimentation - code

test - if output is as expected
